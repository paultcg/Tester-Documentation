There are a number of ‘ilities’ of software that greatly affect the ability of the system to be tested. These are, testability, observability and monitor-ability.

## Why this is important

If you cannot test the system, see what is happening internally or access the logs, it is hard to have confidence in it.

## Outcomes

At the end of this training you will be able to:

* Understand the meaning of the three main ‘ilities’
* Have heard the value these can bring to a project and the damage their lack can cause
* Understand the importance of these ‘ilities’

## Learner Requirements

To have completed the ‘What is Testing?’ module

To have completed the ‘Think like a Tester?’ module

## Outline (agenda)

* Introduction
* Testability
* Observability
* Monitorability
* Summary

## Tasks

* Research and write a definition for testability
* Research and write a definition for observability
* Research and write a definition for monitorability

## Further tasks

Write a paper of up to two sides on the ‘ilities’ explaining how they apply at your work place and how they might be improved
