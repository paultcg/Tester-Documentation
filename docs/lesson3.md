## Description  

Quality is suitability for its defined purpose. If only it were that easy to define what we mean by quality in creating software. In this module we will discuss definitions of quality and understand how they relate to creating software. We will explore the different types of quality and how we might measure them. We will also look at things that can erode quality throughout the process of creating software, from ideation to delivery.

**Why this is important**  

A common phrase these days is, the whole team is responsible for quality. Understanding quality in the context of your work and its value to yourself and others in your team and business is vital in any shared vision of success. Without agreeing on quality, how can the whole team own it? Quality is a subject that comes up regularly from a business describing their services, to a team dedicated to delivering quality. Without that understanding and ability to offer some definitions of measure it can soon become an obstacle for delivery.
