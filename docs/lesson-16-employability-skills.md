## **Description**

While it is easy to understand what we mean by functional testing, people have been trying for years to define a term to replace non-functional testing. These quality attributes broadly encompass anything that isn’t functional such as accessibility, performance, usability, security etc. Some of these are viewed as specialisms, others their own role but as testers it is important for us to have some understanding to identify risks and ask informed questions.

**Why this is important**

Software does not function in isolation. It is deployed or accessed through networks, used by many people with differing needs across a growing multitude of platforms, devices, browsers and in many different contexts.

Failure to consider non-functional testing can result in website crashes, poor experience, reputational damage, law suits and fines. These also offer options to broaden your career and make you more valuable to companies.
