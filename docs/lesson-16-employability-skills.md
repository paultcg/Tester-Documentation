## **Description**

This could be described as the skills to be employable or simply the skills to secure a job. Some examples include interview skills, growing your reputation, understanding LinkedIn and communities. These are often expected to somehow be known or briefly mentioned. This module seeks to make the subject easier to understand and provide the tools to excel.

**Why this is important**

There are many steps to getting an interview and very little opportunity to practice them. Having a CV and portfolio that shows your skills in the best light can get you seen or spoken to. Being able to respond to a question you don’t know the answer to can put you in a better light. These can make the difference to being offered a role or not.

* Understand what employability skills are and why they are important
