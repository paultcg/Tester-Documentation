## **Description**

One of the main documents produced in testing is how the testing will be done, also described as the test overview. Whatever variation of document is used there are common ground across the different options such as; the scope of the testing. What tools and techniques will be used? What phases and environments does this cover? How will issues be logged and addressed? Most importantly, how you will know when to stop.

Whatever the choice, it is useful to know what is involved, what these areas cover and how to create them.

**Why this is important**

As with documentation and reporting, the creation of these types of documents is where you first begin to think about testing as a whole. If you start with no plan it is easy to forget where you were going. Understanding where to start and how to start well will ensure you are focused throughout the project.
