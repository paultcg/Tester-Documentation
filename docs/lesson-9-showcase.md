## **Description**

Drawing on the skills learnt in previous sessions, we corroborate what we have learned whilst practicing our presentation and public speaking skills in a Showcase.

**Why this is important**

Many testing interviews mandate presentation skills, not to mention day to day testing tasks such as stand ups or other key Scrum ceremonies. Being able to confidently and concisely explain your thoughts, as well as learning the importance of providing a psychologically safe environment for others to feel comfortable presenting in, is a great skill for a tester to have.

## **Outcomes**

At the end of this training you will be able to:

* Understand the importance of psychological safety
* Deliver your Showcase (lightening talk, presentation, demo)
* Receive feedback of your Showcase
* Receive a recording of your Showcase

## **Learner Requirements**

To have completed the ‘Communication in Testing’ module

## **Outline** (agenda)

* Introduction
* Recap of last session (importance of psychological safety and showcase code of conduct)
* Intro for each presentation
* Outro for each presentation (focus on confidence building and positive feedback)
* Overall feedback
* Post-Session editing and individual recordings provided for learner portfolio

## **Tasks**

In the previous session Learners will have been prepped to prepare a short presentation around anything they have learnt so far in the bootcamp.

Presentations format TBD depending on numbers/time but may include:-

* Team or individual presentation (provided each learner presents equally)
* Lightening Talk around 5 minutes in length

## **Further tasks**
