<h2>Description</h2>
Quite often you will hear people talking about ‘the testing mind-set’ or how testers ‘think differently’. What is rarer is hearing people explain what the testing mind-set is or how to think differently. 
In this module you will learn different thought techniques, understand biases and how they affect the generation of test cases. We will create our own mnemonics and cheat sheets to assist testing and lay the foundations for the rest of the apprenticeship. 

<h2>Why this is important</h2>
Those developing software quite rightly have a ‘creators’ mind-set’. They need to focus on making the software work. While it is a myth that testers’ break things it is important to focus on risk and understand what happens when things do go wrong. 

<h2>Outcomes</h2>
At the end of this training you will be able to:

<h2>Create your own definition of the testers’ mind-set </h2>
Understand how thought techniques contribute to testing 
Be aware of the differences context can make to test approaches 
Explain mnemonics, heuristics and oracles and how to use them 
Be aware of bias and how it can be detrimental to testing
