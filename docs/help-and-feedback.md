## Feedback

Feedback is REALLY important to us - we have a really short feedback loop which is essential for us to get better and stay current in our ever changing world. Please let us know what you think.

You can give us feedback at any time at [tcg.fyi/feedback](https://jamstack.tcg.camp/feedback)

At the end of every session we collect anonymous feedback on the JamBoard (link will be pinned in your cohort slack channel)

At points during the course someone from the guild will contact you to check in and get feedback from you.

At the end of the course we will ask you to complete a feedback form.
