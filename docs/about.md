## Introduction
Welcome to the Tester Bootcamp with The Coders Guild.

This bootcamp will aim to take you through some of the really important knowledge to help you develop and hopefully progress into a career as a software tester.

We need to be clear with you the work you will have to undertake and the benefits of completing the bootcamp. Working in IT as a software tester can be a rewarding career for people from many different backgrounds. Completing the course can give you the knowledge tools and artefacts to gain entry to a full apprenticeship or secure a junior testing role.
