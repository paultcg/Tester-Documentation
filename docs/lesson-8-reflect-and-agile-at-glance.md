## **Description**

Documentation and reporting are important. More so in some settings than others but there will be some.

**Why this is important**

A common phrase these days is, the whole team is responsible for quality. Understanding quality in the context of your work and its value to yourself and others in your team and business is vital in any shared vision of success. Without agreeing on quality, how can the whole team own it?

Quality is a subject that comes up regularly from a business describing their services, to a team dedicated to delivering quality. Without that understanding and ability to offer some definitions of measure it can soon become an obstacle for delivery.
