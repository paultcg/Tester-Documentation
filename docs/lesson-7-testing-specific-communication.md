## **Description**

We communicate so much that we often fail to recognise the impact it can have on others. What is meant as an innocent comment can be hurtful and make working situations difficult. There is a skill to offering feedback in a way that engages with those receiving it and this module will help you understand the process and techniques required.

**Why this is important**

Communication is vital to creating quality software. Being critical of others work can be confrontational if done poorly and a positive collaborative experience if done well. Being able to describe behaviour in an engaging and useful way is a fundamental skill of a professional tester.

## **Outcomes**

* Understand the impacts of feedback on collaboration
