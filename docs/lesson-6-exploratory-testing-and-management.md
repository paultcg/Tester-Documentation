One of the key skills software testers need is the ability to undertake exploratory testing. Focused, targeted and skilful exploratory testing can find potential issues that might not otherwise surface. The ability to learn, design, execute, adapt and interpret in one session is a skill that takes practice, but will make you a highly sought after test professional. This approach to testing can be applied at multiple stages in the design and creation of software.

## Why this is important

Exploratory testing is one of the quickest ways to gather information on a system to allow quick feedback loops. Being able, in a short period of time, to learn about a product or new feature and offer insights to your team is invaluable as we strive for speed of delivery while maintaining quality.
